This is a word game.
The idea is inspired from a past(?) TV show.
Players request for a combination of consonants and vowels, which are given at random;
they then have to make top scoring words from the given combination

How to play
Player requests a random combination of vowels and consonants.
When given they have 25 seconds to make the most words they can from the combination given.
Their final points at the end of the game are a sum of the points of the individual words they've come up with.
